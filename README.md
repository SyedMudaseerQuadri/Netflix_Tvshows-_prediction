# 🎬 Netflix Shows Analysis Project (Temporary Title)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This is a **temporary** documentation file for a data science project focused on **analyzing Netflix content**. This file will be updated with more detailed sections as the project progresses.

**Project Goal:**
The primary objective is to gain insights into the Netflix catalog data and build a predictive model.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Initial data cleaning (handling missing values, format conversion).
* Visualizing key features (e.g., distribution of content types, top directors/actors, genre trends over time).
* Identifying potential correlations and patterns in the data.

### 2. Predictive Modeling (Random Forest)
* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier/Regressor (The final choice will be determined by the specific prediction task, e.g., predicting content rating, popularity, or type).
* **Goal:** To build an initial baseline model based on the features derived from EDA.

## 💾 Data Source

* **Source:** (e.g., Kaggle: Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, or specific web scrape).
* **Files:** (List main data files, e.g., `netflix_titles.csv`).

## 🛠️ Setup (Future Update)

* Detailed instructions on how to install dependencies and run the notebooks/scripts will be provided here.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Refine the Random Forest model and compare it with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression).
* Perform more advanced feature engineering.
* Develop an interactive dashboard to showcase the EDA findings.
